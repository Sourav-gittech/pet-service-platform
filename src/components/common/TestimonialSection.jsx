I was really happy with both sits The quality of care and attention given to my dog and home was exceptional. I met the sitters beforehand which made me feel comfortable. I would not hesitate to use this site again It's easy to navigate I just entered my dates and people started to apply. It was really great for the sitters to have previous reviews that were helpful." },

I believe it's the foundation of TrustedHousesitters that made it all go so well, so smoothly, so perfect. The way it's planned, the questions and answers, all the information required is there. I expected things to go well, but all exceeded my expectations. I'm truly satisfied and relaxed to continue." },

This was our first time using the service. We couldn‚Äôt ask for a better house sitter. We were gone for two weeks came back to a happy dog, a clean house, and healthy plants. Best of all our housesitter was the nicest and most interesting person. Highly recommended." },

This has been a fast efficient service and can say the whole experience was 1st class! Our sitters were way better than our expectations and hope everyone enjoys the same!!!" },
